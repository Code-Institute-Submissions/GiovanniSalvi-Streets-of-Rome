**_Welcome!_** [github](https://github.com/GiovanniSalvi/Streets-of-Rome)

# UX

## I realized this project as part of the User centric front-end development module that I am completing at "code academy" training course.

### The website has been designed in order to raise interest, discover and visit the city(as i already stated on the homepage)where I am from and give tools and information in a appealing way as much as clear possible to users be interested about it.

###  My attempt to make the website attractive is based on giving to the potential users a very straight-forward picture on why it is worth to visit the place by showing a collection of a few clear images of the city.


---
### User stories:
* as a user I want have an overview about the main turistic and historical hotspots so that I can plan my trip that better suits me.

* as a turist I want use the map through the link in the homepage  to figure out which are the  optimal means to explore  the city based on time and budget I have.

* as a user I want to be able to subscribe the newsletter.

## Bugs discovered:

### Solved bugs

 1. Hero image animation issue

    * When Homepage was displayed on desktop screen size, resolution above 1600px width and 992px height, image appeared half cutted off.
    * To solve this issue I removed background-attachement property and used background-position giving a value of -50px
      then i set background image's height value to 595px in order to fit it into the section-title classed div.

``` 
.section-title {
    width: 100vw;
    height: 595px;
    background-image: url(https://www.csoalastrada.net/core-online/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Roma-in-nero.jpg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: -50px;
    padding: 0.2px;
    transition: ease-out;
    animation-name: container-image-outer;
    animation-duration: 3s;
    animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}                
```
