"Street of Rome"
I realized this project as part of the User centric front-end development module that I am completing at "code academy" training course.

The website has been designed in order to raise interest to know and visit the city(as i already stated on the homepage)where I am from and give tools and information in a appealing way as much as clear possible to users having an interested in it.

My attempt to make the website attractive is based on giving to the potential users a very straight-forward picture on why it is worth to visit the place by showing a collection of a few clear images of the city and a handy path to find out more informations about it using some links which gives to the people a easy way to achieve their needs.

Feature 1:Header provides links to the most popular travel agencies and websites.

Feature2:Homepage's body provides few popular sights of the city.

Feature 3:Footer explains reasons that stimulates me to make this project.

Technology and Frameworks used: Html,Css,Bootstrap,Font-Awesome library,https://www.eggradients.com/.

Code validation: Code(html,css) validated with https://validator.w3.org/nu/.

Project is designed to have a responsive web design for different layouts(Desktop,Mobile-Tablet).
