**_Welcome!_** [github](https://github.com/GiovanniSalvi/Streets-of-Rome)

# UX

## I realized this project as part of the User centric front-end development module that I am completing at "code academy" training course.

### The website has been designed in order to raise interest to know and visit the city(as i already stated on the homepage)where I am from and give tools and information in a appealing way as much as clear possible to users be interested about it.

###  My attempt to make the website attractive is based on giving to the potential users a very straight-forward picture on why it is worth to visit the place by showing a collection of a few clear images of the city.


---
### User stories:
* as a user I want have an overview about the main turistic and historical hotspots so that I can plan my trip that better suits me.

* as a turist I want use the map through the link in the homepage  to figure out which are the  optimal means to explore  the city based on time and budget I have.

* as a turist
