## Streets-of-Rome

Welcome! 

# UX

## I realized this project as part of the User centric front-end development module   at "Code Academy" training course.

###  The website has been designed in order to raise interest in the city(as i already stated on the homepage)where I am from and give tools and information in a appealing way as much as clear possible to the users to be able to visit.

###  My attempt to make the website attractive is based on giving to the potential users a very straight-forward picture on why it is worth to visit the place by showing a collection of a few clear images of the city and a handy path to find out more informations about it using some links which gives to the user a easy way to raise an interest.
